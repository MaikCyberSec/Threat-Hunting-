🛡️ Threat-Hunting
Threat Hunting Based on KQL (Kusto Query Language)
📌 Overview

Welcome to Threat-Hunting, a practical and research-driven repository focused on proactive threat detection using Kusto Query Language (KQL).

This project is designed to help security analysts, SOC teams, and cybersecurity enthusiasts detect, investigate, and hunt advanced threats across environments such as:

Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Azure Data Explorer

Log Analytics Workspaces

Rather than waiting for alerts, this repository emphasizes proactive threat hunting techniques — identifying suspicious behaviors, uncovering hidden persistence mechanisms, and detecting stealthy attacker activity through powerful KQL queries.

🎯 Objectives

Build real-world, practical KQL hunting queries

Detect attacker TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK–aligned techniques)

Identify anomalies and suspicious behavior patterns

Improve detection engineering skills

Provide reusable and customizable hunting templates
